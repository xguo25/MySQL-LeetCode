Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the second highest salary is 200. If there is no second highest salary, then the 
query should return null.

Answer:
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary)
                FROM Employee);

/*
#A simple way to solve this problem
Select Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
*/
